# Asteroids

This is a simple project which uses `pygame` package to create a simple screen, the _player_ is shaped as a __triangle__ and the _asteroids_ are shaped as __circles__. When the _player_ shoots the _asteroids_ with bullets, the asteroids might either split into 2 parts or entirely disappear.
